I have been working with mobile apps for last 5 years.

Majorly in iOS applications using ReactNative and Native iOS.

Apart from this I got chances to work on 2 Native Android projecs too..
Experience in both domain was an advantage for me when I started with ReactNative.


The clients which I worked belongs to Health domain, Retail E-Commerce Domain and I'm confortable working as with a team and individual contributor.

The project that I have worked on developed in Swift, JavaScript, TypeScript etc..

I have been involved in all stages of development starting from requirement gathering 
to releasing on the app store and playstore.

I had done one specilization course from coursera in Blockchain development. There I was able to explore the blockchain basics and web3.js, Ganache, solidity, basically ethereum app development.
